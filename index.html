            <h2>A funny story</h2>

            <p>Some years back my parents took me and a friend to somewhere in France I can't quite remember the name of,
                either way it was hot there so it was probably somewhere in the southern area.</p>
            <p>One night my friend already went up to our room to get some shut-eye while I remained downstairs to finish watching
                whatever english speaking show as on at the time. After that I went up to our room and closed the door behind me,
                my friend protested saying it was "too fucking hot to have the door closed" which was something I heard before but I
                prefer sleeping with the damn door closed so usually I ignored it.</p>
            <p>This night however, was different. After closing the door and looking towards my friend's bed to call him a bitch and
                tell him to close the door himself I spotted a peculiar black spot on the wall above him. This black spot was an
                absolutely massive spider, and it's not like I'm super scared of spiders but honestly this thing was gigantic.
                So gigantic in fact my friend spotted the pure horror in my eyes and followed my gaze upwards towards this titan of
                a monster. What followed was chaos: high-pitched screaming, wild flailing and fleeing.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, after we calmed down and explained to my parents our room got invaded we decided that my friend was to
                slay the spider clad in battle armour made out of several sweaters and armed with a shoe. There's no satisfying end
                to this shitty story because as we all know spiders can't really resist getting slammed with a size 45 shoe.</p>

            <h3>TL;DR</h3>

            <p>Two imbeciles have panic attack because moderately large spider is in the room.</p>
